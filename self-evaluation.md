# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful? Each could have many uses but the most obvious one to me is seperating out a large dataset using certain parameters and giving customized data-dependent outputs.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? I had trouble on this assignment because I was only assigning one end statement to my .each call and my conditional. This was easily fixed, I just need to remember to end all of my statements in the future. 
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment? This assignment was fairly straightforward for me aside from the aforementioned issue. I was able to take a step back and come back and then solved that issue relatively quickly. Aside from that it was just a little bit of finding in the Ruby docs which is always extremely helpful to my learning.
